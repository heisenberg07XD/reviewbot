      "reviewText": "I needed a tall chair of a particular height for a certain purpose. I ordered the chair because the height matched my requirement. When I received the chair I found that the actual height is much shorter than the description. The legs were not square as shown in the picture. That was manageable for me, but I not the height. There was no refund policy. So, I requested for replacement. That process took time. The Amazon officials were transferring the call from one person to another person. However after couple of calls and several round of call transferring replacement was registered. Replacement was done smoothly. But the new chair was exactly similar to the earlier one in terms of height and design. From my experience of replacement request registration I didn't feel encouraged to lodge a complain. After all we have our jobs to be done. The chair is still lying idle at my office with no use. Sometimes it is used for cleaning ceilings etc. In some cases sellers are novice and they cannot comprehend the importance of specifications. So Amazon need to be careful that product specifications are correct."

Wood finishing is super. Also it is having perfect sturdiness. Comfort aspect that seating area should be little wider. Measured Seating width is 14.9inch whereas specified width is 16inch. Rest all worth to buy this product. Thanks to Amazon and seller. Bottom Bushes are not available on the chair legs."
